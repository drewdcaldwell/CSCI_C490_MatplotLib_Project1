<p>Hello. Welcome to my first data analysis project in python. This was completed for my Senior Seminar in Computer Science course on February 1st, 2024.
I take a look at some of the rural counties in North-East Central Indiana, and try to make data driven conclusions about their poverty rate, household income, and
the race distribution using some different charts that are available in the matplotlib library. </p>
