<h2>Welcome to my first data analysis project</h2>

<p>Welcome to my first data analysis project in python. To see my final result, the file is "Project1.ipynb" This was completed for my Senior Seminar in Computer 
  Science course on February 1st, 2024.I take a look at some of the rural counties in North-East Central Indiana, and try to make data driven conclusions about 
  their poverty rate, household income, and the race distribution using some different charts that are available in the matplotlib library. </p>
